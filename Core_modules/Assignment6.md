## Solutions

#### Q1.What is Collection in Java?
Java Collections means a single unit of objects.Java Collection frameworks provides many interfaces(Set,List,Queue,Deque) and classes(ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack,PriorityQueue,HashSet,LinkedHashSet,TreeSet)

#### Q2.Differentiate between Collection and collections in the context of Java.
Collection is the interface where you group objects into a single unit. Collections is a utility class that has some set of operations you perform on Collection. Collection does not have all static methods in it, but Collections consist of methods that are all static.

#### Q3. What are the advantages of the Collection framework?
The primary advantages of a collections framework are that it: Reduces programming effort by providing data structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them yourself. Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of data structures and algorithms.

#### Q4.Explain the various interfaces used in the Collection framework.
Java Collection framework provides many interfaces like Set, List, Queue, Deque. 

#### Q5.Differentiate between List and Set in Java.
The main difference between List and Set is that Set is unordered and contains different elements, whereas the list is ordered and can contain the same elements in it. 

#### Q6.What is the Differentiate between Iterator and ListIterator in Java.
The basic difference between Iterator and ListIterator is that both being cursor, Iterator can traverse elements in a collection only in forward direction. On the other hand, the ListIterator can traverse in both forward and backward directions. Using iterator you can not add any element to a collection.

#### Q7.What is the Differentiate between Comparable and Comparator
Comparable interface can be used to provide single way of sorting whereas Comparator interface is used to provide different ways of sorting. For using Comparable, Class needs to implement it whereas for using Comparator we don't need to make any change in the class.

#### Q8.What is collision in HashMap?
A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.

#### Q9.Distinguish between a hashmap and a Treemap.
HashMap allows a single null key and multiple null values. TreeMap does not allow null keys but can have multiple null values. HashMap allows heterogeneous elements because it does not perform sorting on keys. TreeMap allows homogeneous values as a key because of sorting.

#### Q10.Define LinkedHashMap in Java
The LinkedHashMap class of the Java collections framework provides the hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface.
