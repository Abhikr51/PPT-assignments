The given code has an issue with the initial accumulator object. The accumulator needs to be an object with two properties, evens and odds, both initialized as empty arrays. Additionally, the reduce() method should provide an initial value for the accumulator as the second argument.

Here's the fixed code with the issues resolved:
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] }); // Provide initial value as an object with 'evens' and 'odds' properties

console.log(result);
```

Explanation of the output:

The reduce() method iterates through the numbers array, and for each element, it checks whether the number is even or odd. Based on this check, it adds the number to the corresponding property (evens or odds) in the accumulator object.

After iterating through all the numbers, the result will be an object with two properties: evens and odds. The evens property will contain an array with all the even numbers from the numbers array, and the odds property will contain an array with all the odd numbers.

For the given numbers array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output will be:
```js
{
  evens: [2, 4],
  odds: [1, 3, 5]
}
```
