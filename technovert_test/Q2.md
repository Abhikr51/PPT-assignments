This code snippet contains a for loop that runs from i = 0 to i < 5. Inside the loop, there is a setTimeout function that schedules a callback to be executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds.

The callback function inside setTimeout is an arrow function that prints the current value of i to the console using console.log(i).

During the loop, the value of i changes from 0 to 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, by the time the first callback executes after 100 milliseconds, the loop has already finished running, and the value of i is 5.So, when the scheduled callbacks are finally executed, they all print the value of i, which is now 5 (the value that caused the loop to terminate). As a result, you see five 5 printed to the console.
Output :
0
1
