Question 4
You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.
You always start to construct the **left** child node of the parent first if it exists.
**Input:** s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"

**Output:** [4,2,6,3,1,5]
