Output will shows in this order 1 4 3 2 . Here first line is exicuted then Last line because setTime out always gets added to the event queue and will be executed after other tasks  

- console.log(1); 
This line logs the number 1 to the console first.

- setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);
This line schedules a function to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). So, the function that logs 2 will be executed after a 1-second delay.

- setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);
This line schedules a function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds. While it appears that it should log 3 immediately, it actually gets added to the event queue along with the other setTimeout callbacks.

- console.log(4);
This line logs the number 4 to the console immediately after the first console.log(1).
