The output of the code will be as follows:

1
4
2
3


console.log(1);
This line logs the number 1 to the console.

setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);
This line schedules the function printNumber(2) to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is specified as 0, the printNumber(2) function will be added to the event queue after the current synchronous code finishes executing.

setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);
This line schedules the function printNumber(3) to be executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds. Since it has a delay, printNumber(3) will be placed in the event queue after printNumber(2).

console.log(4);
This line logs the number 4 to the console.

Since the printNumber(2) function was scheduled with a delay of 0 milliseconds and printNumber(3) was scheduled with a delay of 100 milliseconds, printNumber(2) will be executed before printNumber(3).
