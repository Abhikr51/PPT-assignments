Sharding is a data partitioning technique used in MongoDB to horizontally scale large databases across multiple servers or clusters. It is designed to address the challenges of handling large amounts of data and high write and read loads by distributing the data across multiple machines, known as shards. Sharding allows MongoDB to scale out, providing increased storage capacity and improved performance.
In a sharded MongoDB cluster, data is divided into smaller chunks called "shards," and each shard is stored on a separate server. Each shard is essentially a standalone MongoDB replica set that consists of primary and secondary nodes to ensure high availability and data redundancy.
