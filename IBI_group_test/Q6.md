Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code.

Using Named Functions:Instead of using anonymous functions as callbacks, you can define named functions for each operation. This improves code readability and separates the concerns of each asynchronous operation.
```js
function callback1(result1) {
  asyncOperation2(result1, callback2);
}
function callback2(result2) {
  asyncOperation3(result2, callback3);
}
asyncOperation1(arg1, callback1);
```
=================================
Using Promises:Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell. Each asynchronous operation returns a Promise, and you can use .then() to chain them together.
```js
asyncOperation1(arg1)
  .then((result1) => {
    return asyncOperation2(result1);
  })
  .then((result2) => {
    return asyncOperation3(result2);
  })
  .then((result3) => {
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```
=================================
Using async/await:async/await is a more recent addition to JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, making it even more readable. You can use async functions to await the results of asynchronous operations.
```js
async function performAsyncOperations() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncOperation1(arg1);
    // ...
    const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
    // ...
    const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}
performAsyncOperations();
```
Using async/await with Promise.all : When there are independent asynchronous operations that can be executed concurrently, you can use Promise.all to run them in parallel and await their results.
```js
async function performAsyncOperations() {
  try {
    const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([
      asyncOperation1(arg1),
      asyncOperation2(arg2),
    ]);
    // ...
    const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}

performAsyncOperations();
```
